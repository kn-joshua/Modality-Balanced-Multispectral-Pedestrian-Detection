# Multispectral-Pedestrian-Detection-MBNet-Implementation
This repository is a implementation of the paper "Improving Multispectral Pedestrian Detection by Addressing Modality Imbalance Problems" by Kailai Zhou, Linsen Chen and Xun Cao (Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03043v2). Further, we summarise the paper and all of it's methodology for easy understanding for a beginner audience.

## What are the different modalities in multispectral pedestrian detection?

## What were the problems in "balancing" these various modalities?

## What are the main contributions of this paper?

## Methodology
